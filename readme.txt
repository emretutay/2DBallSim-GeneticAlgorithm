Ball throwing simulation SDL game that uses RGA

Ball thrown randomly from the top of the map to reach the bottom(goal).
RGA algorithm creates better throws each generation.
Currently works only on a windows pc with mingw and mingw32-make installed(might need to be built using mingw32-make command)
